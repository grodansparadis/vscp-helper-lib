The VSCP helper library is a collection of library tools for VSCP program development. This library includes most of the helper functionality that is needed by a programmer to interface Level I drivers (previously called CANAL drivers) and functionality to interface a local or remote VSCP daemon (Level II) over TCP/IP and a lot of other things. All helper functionality and all communication functionality is included in the library.

You can either use the library in binary form as a set of C exported functions delivered by a dynamically loaded library or by including a number of C++ classes in your project.

The library is currently available for [c/c++](https://www.vscp.org/#download), [python](https://github.com/grodansparadis/pyvscp) and [node.js]() and is available on Unix/Linux and Windows. It should be easily ported to Mac and other systems.

The library is licensed: under [the  MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) so it can be used freely in open and closed project.
